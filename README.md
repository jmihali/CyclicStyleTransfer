This project is based on the work of Gatys et. al [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html) and on its [code](https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer.git). 

To run the code you need to get the pytorch VGG19-Model from [Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) by running:
